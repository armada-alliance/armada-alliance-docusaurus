# Securing Stake pool Connections & Monitoring with Tailscale

This guide will demonstrate how to use [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) to manage a [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) VPN, securely connecting your
block producer and relays. You will learn to scrape data with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and display it using [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)
within the VPN, without the need to manage TLS certificates or opening any ports except the public ports for your relays.

Additionally, the guide covers setting up Grafana [alerts](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/) and configuring
[notifications](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/configure-notifications/) to be sent to a Telegram bot.
This bot can then be added to a Telegram group for real-time alerting.

More information on the various [notification contact points](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/configure-notifications/manage-contact-points/)
supported by Grafana, including Telegram, Email, Discord, and others.
:::

:::tip
It is best to have Grafana and Prometheus on their own dedicated machine outside of the block producers local network or set them up on a relay looking in.
This way you can be alerted if the BP loses connectivity.

You can also have several instances of Grafana on different machines using the same Prometheus data source. I do this so I can always have Grafana locally for my
viewing pleasure. It loads a lot faster when it's local ðŸ˜Ž. Alerting only needs to be setup on the one looking in.
:::

## Creating a Tailscale VPN

Head over to the [Tailscale quick start page](https://tailscale.com/kb/1017/install), create an account and start adding machines.
Start by adding your local machine or laptop. It is very easy to install Tailscale on your machines just follow the instructions. You can also install it on your phone
to view dashboard on the go.

This guide will also make your block producer "portable". Meaning you can connect your block producer to the internet from anywhere and it will instantly 
reestablish communication with your relays without further configuration âš¡.

### Adding Machines

Follow the instructions for adding the nodes that make up your pool and a machine to host Grafana. This does not have to be a separate machine, 
though as mentioned above, it's preferable to have it looking in at the block producer. This way, if the BP goes offline, you will still be able to receive alerts.

Installing Tailscale on Ubuntu is just running the below script then visiting the link that is output to terminal and authorizing the machine on the Tailscale website.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
```

You will see a new `tailscale0` network interface added to each machine. You can control traffic to these interfaces
with iptables, UFW, or Firewalld on the `tailscale0` interface. Additionally, you can use Tailscale's ACL feature to group machines and control which
ports are open between machines in that group.


```bash
ip a
```

### Disable Key Expiry

:::caution
Failure to disable key expiry will knock your pool offline when they expire after 180 days. Don't skip this step. You have been warned.
:::

Once the machines are added you should disable key expiry on each machine or the keys used to connect to the VPN will expire after 180 days and those
nodes will be unable to connect. You can do this on the [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) website by clicking the ... for each machine and choosing 'Disable key expiry'.
You can always generate new keys at any time if you wish. If you do get locked out you can toggle the expiry on the website and restart the server to get back into it.

### Access Control layer

Click the 'Access controls' tab on the [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) website. By default there is a rule to allow all traffic on all ports between the machines in the tailnet.
This is fine to get started but know you have the ability to group machines and only allow certain ports to communicate through the VPN to machines in that group.
For example I have a mainnet and a testnet group and only allow the ports needed for those machines.

```json
        // my laptop does what it wants
		{"action": "accept", "src": ["tag:kingOfKings"], "dst": ["*:*"]},
		{
			"action": "accept",
			"src":    ["autogroup:members"],
			"dst":    ["autogroup:internet:*"],
		},
		{ // mainnet machines can communicate on said ports
			"action": "accept",
			"src":    ["tag:cardano-mainnet"],
			"dst": ["tag:cardano-mainnet:6000-6003,9090,5000,12798,12800,9100,9190,3000,1337,9615"],
		},
		{ // testnet machines can communicate on said ports
			"action": "accept",
			"src":    ["tag:cardano-testnets"],
			"dst":    ["tag:cardano-preview:3000-3003,9090,5000,12798,12800,9100,22"],
		}
```

This is just an example of what my groups look like. Consult the documentation on ACL when you are ready to tighten up access.
Be aware that ports are closed by default and that one default rule is what is allowing communication for all machines on all ports.

### Update cardano-node topology files.

You can get a list of the machine names, IP address' and some other connection info of the machines in your 'tailnet' from their website or by running..

```bash
sudo tailscale status
```

:::tip
You can remove HOSTADDR=0.0.0.0 entirely from your cardano-node startup script(if present) to enable connections using Tailscale's IPv6 address'. cardano-node will
use both IPv4 and IPv6 if that line is not present.
:::

Let's test communication. When you setup Tailscale it creates a nameserver that the VPN can use to resolve machine hostnames to their VPN IP address.
You should be able to ping or SSH to the IPv4, IPv6 address or machine name of a node from other machines in the VPN. You can also use cardano-cli to test
they can connect before editing your topology files.

```bash
cardano-cli ping -h <Tailscale IP or Tailscale DNS name> -p <port>
```

Test this out on each machine. You can then go in to your cardano-node topology file and update all the address to their Tailscale IP. 

#### Example with block producer & backup block producer in localRoots using the tailscale0 interface IPv4.

```json  
    "localRoots": [
    { "accessPoints": [
      { "address": "100.90.109.57", "port": 6000, "name": "My core" },
      { "address": "100.118.76.131", "port": 6000, "name": "Backup core" }
      ],
      "advertise": false,
      "trustable": true,
      "valency": 2
    },
    ]
```

## Monitoring

We first need to tell cardano-node to have the metrics available to all interfaces and not just localhost. This way Prometheus will be able to access the
metrics when they are on another machine in the VPN. Open cardano-node's config.json and update the hasPrometheus section like this. Do this for all the
machines running cardano-node. Keep in mind you'll need to do this every time you pull in a new config.json when upgrading.

```json
  "hasPrometheus": [
    "0.0.0.0",
    12798
  ],
```

Next make sure you have prometheus-node-exporter installed on every machine you plan to add to the dashboard.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo apt install prometheus-node-exporter
sudo systemctl enable prometheus-node-exporter.service
```

### Prometheus & Grafana

Prometheus scrapes data from cardano-node and the Linux host with node exporter and serves the scraped metrics over http. Grafana in turn can use that data to
display graphs and create alerts etc. Our Grafana dashboard will be made up of data from our Ubuntu system(prometheus-node-exporter) & cardano-node.

:::info PROMETHEUS REPOSITORY

[https://github.com/prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus)

:::

![](/img/pi-pool-grafana.png)

### Install Prometheus.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo apt install prometheus
```

### Configure Prometheus

Open prometheus.yml.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo nano /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

:::caution

Indentation must be correct YAML format or Prometheus will fail to start.

:::

Replace the contents of the file with below make sure you fill in the Tailscale ipv4 address for each machine twice. Once for cardano-node metrics and
then again for prometheus node exporter metrics. Which is just server metrics like RAM, CPU etc.

:::info
If you have other machines or services you would like to add to your dashboard you can add them here. Mithril, Aya devnet, testnets etc.
:::

```yaml title="/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml"
global:
  scrape_interval:     5s # By default, scrape targets every 15 seconds.

  # Attach these labels to any time series or alerts when communicating with
  # external systems (federation, remote storage, Alertmanager).
  external_labels:
    monitor: 'codelab-monitor'

# A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:
# Here it's Prometheus itself.

        labels:
          alias: 'C1'
          type:  'cardano-node'

      - targets: ['<backup core ip addr>:12798']
        labels:
          alias: 'C2'
          type:  'cardano-node'

      - targets: ['<relay 1 ip addr>:12798']
        labels:
          alias: 'R1'
          type:  'cardano-node'

      - targets: ['<relay 2 ip addr>:12798']
        labels:
          alias: 'R2'
          type:  'cardano-node'

      - targets: ['<relay 3 ip addr>:12798']
        labels:
          alias: 'R3'
          type:  'cardano-node'

    # prometheus node exporter metrics

          type:  'node'

      - targets: ['<backup core ip addr>:9100']
        labels:
          alias: 'C2'
          type:  'node'

      - targets: ['<relay 1 ip addr>:9100']
        labels:

          type:  'node'

      - targets: ['<relay 2 ip addr>:9100']
        labels:
          alias: 'R2'
          type:  'node'

      - targets: ['<relay 3 ip addr>:9100']
        labels:
          alias: 'R3'
          type:  'node'

```

Save & exit.

Start Prometheus, you can check if it's running and follow the services logs with.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo systemctl start prometheus.service
sudo systemctl status prometheus.service
journalctl -u prometheus.service -f
```

If everything looks good tell Systemd to start the service at boot.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo systemctl enable prometheus.service
```

:::tip
You can now open the browser on your laptop if Tailscale is installed on it and got to http://prometheus-server-ip:9090
:::

### Install Grafana

:::info GRAFANA REPOSITORY

[https://github.com/grafana/grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana)

:::

Install the prerequisite packages.

```bash
sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https software-properties-common wget
```

Import Grafana's gpg key to Ubuntu.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings/
wget -q -O - https://apt.grafana.com/gpg.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/grafana.gpg > /dev/null
```

Add latest stable repo to apt sources.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/grafana.gpg] https://apt.grafana.com stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grafana.list
```

Update your package lists & install Grafana.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo apt update; sudo apt install grafana
```

Optionally, change the port on which Grafana listens to port 5000 to avoid clashes with cardano-node, which commonly uses port 3000.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo sed -i /etc/grafana/grafana.ini \
         -e "s#;http_port#http_port#" \
         -e "s#3000#5000#"
```

Start Grafana, you can check if it's running and follow the services logs with.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo systemctl start grafana-server.service
sudo systemctl status grafana-server.service
journalctl -u grafana-server.service -f
```

If everything looks good tell Systemd to start the service at boot.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo systemctl enable grafana-server.service
```

You should now be able to open Grafana with the Tailscale IP addr or hostname of the machine it is installed
on from your local machine. Here is an example.

http://100.120.233.29:3000

It will ask you to set a username and password on first log in. The next step is adding our Prometheus
data source. In Grafana's sidebar find the data sources page. They have changed the URL/name a few times.
For my installation it is http://100.120.233.29:3000/connections/datasources.

Click on 'Add new data source'. The only section we need to edit here is 'Prometheus server URL'.
If Prometheus is on the same server as Grafana you can just add http://localhost:9090 then hit
the Save & test button. If Prometheus is on a different server add it's Tailscale IP in place of localhost.

## Dashboard/s

We can now grab the [dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/armada-alliance/dashboards/main/Armada-Alliance.json) for this guide and import it into Grafana. Download this dashboard somewhere
on your local machine. Next find the Dashboards tab in Grafana and click 'New' then 'Import'. Choose the dash you
you just downloaded above.

If every things connected correctly you can now choose the dashboard from the Dashboards sidebar to view it.

## Alerting to Telegram

### Create a Telegram bot

Go to [https://t.me/botfather](https://t.me/botfather) in Telegram and create a new bot and give it a name and username, then copy your API access token.

> /newbot
>
> Grafana\_Alerts
>
> my\_\_pool\_\_bot

Something like that. Get creative.

### Create a Telegram group

In Telegram you can create a group by clicking on the :pencil:symbol next to the search bar. You can go back and add an image and change the name later.
You can also add the bot to an existing group/s.

### Add your bot to the new group

:::info
Return to Bot Father if you need a link to your bot or if you need the api token.

[https://t.me/botfather](https://t.me/botfather)
:::

Open botfather Follow the t.me link to your bot. Start/enable the bot and click on the three dots and 'Add to Group'. Add your bot to your new group.

### Find your groups Chat ID

:::caution
You may have to post in your new group if you cannot find the chat.id that starts with a - sign. Also Firefox displays the json returned in an easier to read format than Chrome.
:::

Paste your bots API token into the url below. Determine your Chat ID. Starts with - sign like below.

```
https://api.telegram.org/bot\<YOUR BOT API TOKEN>/getUpdates

```

![ID will start with a - sign like above](/img/alert.chat.id.png)

## Create a notification channel in Grafana

Click on Alerting in Grafana's left hand vertical menu and choose notification channels. Choose 'Contact Points'. Give it a name and choose Telegram under integration. Enter the token and the chat id value you copied earlier. Click test and you should get a green 'test notification sent' and a message in your new group. If so go ahead and click save.

### Add profile image for your bot

Return to [botfather](https://t.me/botfather) and type /setuserpic choose your bot and click the paperclip icon to choose the image.

## Creating Alerts

Unfortunately alerting rules do not export with the dashboard so we will have to go through setting alerts.
I am going to show a few I have setup which is a good start and focuses only on alerting for cardano-node.

Specifically we will alert if a node is not receiving tx's into it's mempool, if the chains block height stalls and if peers drop
below a set threshold. You can of course go crazy with it just remember sometimes less is more and you do not
want a lot of noise on the alerts.

### No tx's in mempool for 3 minutes.

Open the dashboard and edit the 'C1 Tx's in Mempool' panel. Click on the Alert tab just below the displayed metrics.
Click on 'New alert rule' Give the rule a name. I used 'C1 Mempool tx'. Fill it in using the image below. Fill it in using the image below.
You can then repeat this for each node.

![](/img/C1-mempool-alert.png)

### Block height stall longer than 3 minutes.

Now edit the 'Block Height' panel, click the Alert tab and make it look like this. I named this rule 'Height stall > 3m'.

![](/img/block-height-alert.png)

### Peer count.

For this one an alert will be created for each of the Peers panel. This will differ depending on the nodes role.
A BP only connects to your relays. In this guide there are 3 relays connected to each BP 4 if you connect both BP's
to each others topology file.

Relays on the other hand will have a much higher peer count. This is what I have on this dashboard for C1 & R1 panels.

#### C1-C2 Peers alert

#### R1-R3 Peers alert
